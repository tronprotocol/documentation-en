# Deploying a java-tron Node

This document guides developers on how to deploy a TRON java-tron node on `Linux` or `macOS` operating systems.

**Important Note:** The java-tron node currently requires **Oracle JDK 1.8**. Other JDK versions are not supported.


## Hardware Configuration Requirements

The minimum hardware configuration required to run a java-tron node is as follows:

* **CPU**: 8 Cores
* **Memory**: 16 GB
* **SSD**: 3 TB
* **Network Bandwidth**: 100 Mbps

The recommended configuration is:

* **CPU**: 16 Cores
* **Memory**: 32 GB
* **SSD**: 3.5 TB+
* **Network Bandwidth**: 100 Mbps

For a Super Representative (SR) node acting as a **block production node**, the recommended configuration is:

* **CPU**: 32 Cores
* **Memory**: 64 GB
* **SSD**: 3.5 TB+
* **Network Bandwidth**: 100 Mbps


## Obtaining the java-tron Client

You can directly download the official client [here](https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/releases), or you can compile the source code yourself to package the client.

### Compiling java-tron Source Code

Before you begin compiling, ensure that **git** is installed on your system.

1. First, clone the java-tron source code to your local machine using the `git` command and switch to the `master` branch:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron.git
  git checkout -t origin/master
  ```

2. Then, execute the following commands to compile the java-tron source code:

  ```
  cd java-tron
  ./gradlew clean build -x test
  ```

  * The parameter `-x test` indicates skipping the execution of test cases. You can remove this parameter to execute test code during compilation, but this will extend the compilation time.
  * After compilation is complete, the `FullNode.jar` file will be generated in the `java-tron/build/libs/` directory.

## Starting a java-tron Node

You can choose different configuration files to connect the java-tron node to different TRON networks:

* For Mainnet FullNode configuration file: [config.conf](https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/blob/master/framework/src/main/resources/config.conf)
* For other network node configuration:
    * Nile Testnet: https://nileex.io/
    * Private Network: please refer to [Private Network](https://tronprotocol.github.io/documentation-en/using_javatron/private_network/)

### Starting a FullNode

A **FullNode** serves as an entry point to the TRON network, possesses complete historical data, and provides external access via **HTTP API**, **gRPC API**, and **JSON-RPC API**. You can interact with the TRON network through a FullNode for activities such as asset transfers, smart contract deployments, and smart contract interactions.

Below is the command to start a **Mainnet FullNode**, specifying the configuration file with the `-c` parameter:

```
java -Xmx24g -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -jar FullNode.jar -c config.conf
```

* `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC`: Specifies the **Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) garbage collector**. This parameter must be placed before the `-jar` parameter.
* `-Xmx`: Sets the maximum Java Virtual Machine (JVM) heap size, typically recommended to be **80% of physical memory**.
* To start a **Nile Testnet FullNode** or **Private Network FullNode**, use the corresponding configuration file links provided at the beginning of this section.

### Starting a Block Production Node

By adding the `--witness` parameter to the FullNode startup command above, the `FullNode` will run as a **Block Production Node** (SR Node). In addition to supporting all FullNode functionalities, a Block Production Node also supports **block production** and **transaction packaging**.

**Important Notes**:

* Ensure that you own a Super Representative (SR) account and have received sufficient votes. If your vote count ranks among the top 27, you need to start an SR Node to participate in block production.
  * Note that even if your node doesn't make it into the top 27, a node started with the `--witness` parameter will still operate as a regular node; once its ranking reaches the top 27, it can immediately begin producing blocks.
* Fill in the **private key** of your Super Representative account in the `localwitness` list of `config.conf`.

Here is an example of the `localwitness` configuration:

```
localwitness = [
    650950B1...295BD812
]
```

Then execute the following command to start the Block Production Node:

```
java -Xmx24g -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -jar FullNode.jar --witness -c config.conf
```

### Master-Slave Mode for Block Production FullNodes

To enhance the reliability of block production FullNodes, you can deploy multiple block production FullNodes for the same account, forming a master-slave mode. When an account with block production rights deploys two or more nodes, it's necessary to configure `node.backup` in each node's configuration file. The description of `node.backup` configuration items is as follows:

```
node.backup {
  # udp listen port, each member should have the same configuration
  port = 10001

  # my priority, each member should use different priority
  priority = 8

  # time interval to send keepAlive message, each member should have the same configuration unit: ms
  keepAliveInterval = 3000

  # peer's ip list, can't contain myself
  members = [
    # "ip",
    # "ip"
  ]
}
```

For example, if an account with block production rights deploys three nodes with IPs 192.168.0.100, 192.168.0.101, and 192.168.0.102, respectively, their `node.backup` configurations should be as follows:

- Configuration for IP 192.168.0.100

```
node.backup {
  port = 10001
  priority = 8
  keepAliveInterval = 3000
  members = [
    "192.168.0.101",
    "192.168.0.102"
  ]
}
```

* Configuration for IP 192.168.0.101

```
node.backup {
  port = 10001
  priority = 7
  keepAliveInterval = 3000
  members = [
    "192.168.0.100",
    "192.168.0.102"
  ]
}
```

* Configuration for IP 192.168.0.102

```
node.backup {
  port = 10001
  priority = 6
  keepAliveInterval = 3000
  members = [
    "192.168.0.100",
    "192.168.0.101"
  ]
}
```

**Note**:

* A node will only start the backup service when it has synchronized to the latest state. The latest state is defined as: `(Node's system time - Latest successfully synchronized block time) < Block production interval (time per slot, currently 3s)`.
* When a node with high priority fails and loses its master node status, other slave nodes will compete to become the master node. When the high-priority node recovers and meets the conditions for block production again, it will not automatically regain master node status; it needs to wait until the current master node fails before it can compete for the role again.
* Time required for master-slave switchover: When the master node fails, the time it takes for a slave node to switch to a master node is at least 2 * `keepAliveTimeout`, where `keepAliveTimeout = keepAliveInterval * 6`. Two `keepAliveTimeout` periods are needed because the slave node needs to transition through an intermediate "preparatory" state (INIT) to become the master node: Slave -> INIT -> Master.

## Optimizations and Considerations

### Speeding Up Node Data Synchronization

For Mainnet and Nile Testnet, a newly launched node needs to synchronize a large amount of data, which will take a significant amount of time. You can use [data snapshots](https://tronprotocol.github.io/documentation-en/using_javatron/backup_restore/#main-net-data-snapshot) to accelerate node synchronization.

The operational steps are as follows:

1. Download the latest data snapshot.
2. Unzip it to the `output-directory` within your `tron` project.
3. Then start the node; the node will continue to synchronize based on the data snapshot.

### Specifying Super Representative Account Private Key Using Keystore + Password

To avoid specifying the private key in plaintext within the configuration file, you can choose to use a `keystore` file and password.

1. **Configuration Steps**:
    * Comment out the `localwitness` configuration item in the node configuration file.
    * Uncomment the `localwitnesskeystore` configuration item and fill in the path to the `keystore` file.
    * Note that the `keystore` file needs to be placed in the current directory where the startup command is executed, or in its subdirectory.
        * For example, if the current directory is `A`, and the `keystore` file path is `A/B/localwitnesskeystore.json`, the configuration should be:
          ```
          localwitnesskeystore = ["B/localwitnesskeystore.json"]
          ```
    * You can generate the `keystore` file and password using the `registerwallet` command from the `wallet-cli` project.

2. **Starting a Block Production Node**:

    * **Starting the node interactively without `nohup` (Recommended)**
        * **Important Notes**: This method requires human interaction to enter the password during node startup. It is recommended to use a session persistence tool, such as `screen` or `tmux`.
  
          ```
          java -Xmx24g -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -jar FullNode.jar --witness -c config.conf
          ```

        * During node startup, the system will prompt you to enter the password. After entering the password correctly, the node will complete its startup.

    * **Using `nohup` to pass the password directly in the command line via `--password`**

        ```
        nohup java -Xmx24g -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -jar FullNode.jar --witness -c config.conf --password "your_password" > start.log 2>&1 &
        ```

### Optimizing Memory Usage with `tcmalloc`

To achieve optimal memory usage, use Google's `tcmalloc` instead of the system's `glibc malloc`.

1. **Install `tcmalloc`**:
    * **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / Ubuntu 18.04 LTS / Debian stable**:

      ```
      sudo apt install libgoogle-perftools4
      ```

    * **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS**:

      ```
      sudo apt install libgoogle-perftools4
      ```

    * **CentOS 7**:

      ```
      sudo yum install gperftools-libs
      ```

2. **Modify the Startup Script**:

    * Add the following two lines to your node's startup script. Please note that the path to `libtcmalloc.so.4` might vary slightly across different Linux distributions.

      ```
      #!/bin/bash
  
      export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/libtcmalloc.so.4" # Adjust path according to your system
      export TCMALLOC_RELEASE_RATE=10
  
      # original start command
      java -jar .....
      ```

    * **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / Ubuntu 18.04 LTS / Debian stable**:

      ```
      export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtcmalloc.so.4"
      export TCMALLOC_RELEASE_RATE=10
      ```

    * **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS**:

      ```
      export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/libtcmalloc.so.4"
      export TCMALLOC_RELEASE_RATE=10
      ```

    * **CentOS 7**:

      ```
      export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib64/libtcmalloc.so.4"
      export TCMALLOC_RELEASE_RATE=10
      ```
