title: 'TRC-43: Precompiled contract function for signature parallel verification'
---

## Simple Summary

A new type of precompiled contract function for signature parallel verification.

## Abstract

Add a new type of build-in precompiled contract function for multisign validating instead of the compiled bytecode do the same task.

## Motivation

Since the multi-signature is widely used in Tron, there needs a way for low energy cost and less CPU time multisign validating, the precompiled contract for multi-signature could be a well satisfying solution.

## Specification

Adds a new precompiled contract function named `batchvalidatesign` , which need 3 arguments input:

- bytes32 hash
- bytes[] signatures
- address[] addresses

Sample code

```
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
contract Demo {
    function testBatch(bytes32 hash, bytes[] memory signatures, address[] memory addresses) public returns(bytes32){
        return batchvalidatesign(hash, signatures, addresses);
    }
}
```

output the result of signature validating would be a bytes32, for example `10100000000000000000000000000000` representing the first signatue and third signatue is correct

for safety concern, the number of signatures is limited to 16, when count of signatures is greater than 16,all zero output will be provided.

## Energy cost

energy charge for the execution cost 1500 per signature
