Hello,
 
we are from the ORGON Family Team and are currently working on the Desktop Wallet. Finished products have been in use for over 1 year, including Reward Distribution and Airdrop Tools. Of course we would like to integrate the new technology in our new application.
 
We would be happy to participate in the tests.
 
Many greetings
Marco
ORGON-Family SRC
